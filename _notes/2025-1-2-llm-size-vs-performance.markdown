> 1. Phi-3-7B, a Small Language Model (SLM) with 7 billion parameters [Abdin et al., 2024]
> 2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (2024-10-22), the latest model (≈175B parameters) from the Claude 3.5 family offering
>    state-of-the-art performance across several coding, vision, and reasoning tasks [Anthropic, 2024].
> 3. Gemini 2.0 Flash: the latest/most advanced Gemini model [Google, 2024]. Other Google models such as
>    Med-PaLM models (540B) [Singhal et al., 2023], designed for medical purposes, were not publicly available.
> 4. ChatGPT (≈175B) [OpenAI, 2023a] and GPT-4 (≈1.76T), a "high-intelligence" model [OpenAI, 2023b].
> 5. GPT-4o (≈200B) providing "GPT-4-level intelligence but faster" [OpenAI, 2024a] and the GPT-4o-mini
>    (gpt-4o-2024-05-13) small model (≈8B parameters) for focused tasks [OpenAI, 2024b].
> 6. The latest o1-mini (o1-mini-2024-09-12) model (≈100B) [OpenAI, 2024c], and o1-preview (o1-preview-2024-
>    09-12) model (≈300B) with "new AI capabilities" for complex reasoning tasks [OpenAI, 2024d]. 
> 
> The exact numbers of parameters of several LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini 2.0 Flash) have not been publicly disclosed yet.
> Most numbers of parameters are estimate reported to provide more context for understanding the models’ performance.
