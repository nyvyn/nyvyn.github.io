This is a brief note, I'll add more as I go on this one.

In [Hitting OKRs vs doing your job](https://jessitron.com/2025/01/05/hitting-okrs-vs-doing-your-job/), Jessica Joy Kerr,
highlights the key differences between OKRs and KPIs.

> OKRs highlight a special difference. 
> OKRs are for “What is special about this quarter? What is new? 
> How do we want to be different? What do we want to figure out?” 

> KPIs should measure the core job.
> For engineering teams, that's running software and shipping updates.
> Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) and [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/product/accelerate/) metrics 
> like Deployment Frequency tell us we’re working smoothly.

And this is a great punch "When a team’s OKRs duplicate the roadmap, I read that as 'We aren’t trying to improve. 
This is a quarter for trudging along.' Not a good sign."
