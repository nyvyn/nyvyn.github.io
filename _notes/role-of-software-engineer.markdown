On the eve of 2025, I'm accepting AI-proposed code changes for my hobby projects around 50-80% of the time.

Professional software engineers, those who are paid to write software, will continue the inexorable shift
away from actualy writing code to the myriad of other duties we require of them.

My current take is that we’ll see software engineers evolve to become more like product leaders who can code. As a
consequence, we’ll have far fewer people writing code - with increased specialization of those who do.
