Matryoshka embeddings represent a fascinating approach to neural network embeddings where multiple vector
representations of different dimensions are nested within a single embedding space, much like Russian nesting dolls.
This innovative technique allows for dynamic dimensionality, where shorter vectors can be extracted from longer ones
while preserving semantic relationships, enabling efficient storage and flexible deployment across various computational
constraints without requiring separate models for different embedding sizes.

## Benefits of Matryoshka Embeddings
For example, consider a 1024-dimensional word embedding using the matryoshka principle. The full vector could represent
detailed word semantics, while the first 512 dimensions could capture core meaning, and the first 256 dimensions might
retain essential concepts. This allows deploying the same embedding at different sizes - using all 1024 dimensions on
powerful servers, but only the first 256 on mobile devices, while maintaining semantic consistency across deployments.
