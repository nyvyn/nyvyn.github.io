Two research papers this year demonstrate that generative AI can significantly enhance productivity in the workplace.

The first, an MIT [study][1] in March, "Experimental Evidence on the Productivity Effects of Generative Artificial
Intelligence," found that ChatGPT substantially raises average productivity: time taken decreases by 0.8 standard
deviations and output quality rises by 0.4 standard deviations.

The second [study][2] published a few days ago, "Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier," showed that consultants
equipped with AI, specifically ChatGPT-4, outperformed their peers, completing 12.2% more tasks, 25.1% faster, and
producing 40% higher quality results.

These results are stunning!
But, even more impressively: the most significant improvements were seen among those who initially scored poorly, with a
performance jump of 43%.

This finding, that generative AI is a skill-lever, will have profound impacts on the future of work.

Ethan Mollick, one of the paper's authors [notes][3], "Looking at these results, I do not think enough people are
considering what it means when a technology raises all workers to the top tiers of performance. It may be like how it
used to matter whether miners were good or bad at digging through rockâ€¦ until the steam shovel was invented and now
differences in digging ability do not matter anymore. AI is not quite at that level of change, but skill levelling is
going to have a big impact."

Wow.
