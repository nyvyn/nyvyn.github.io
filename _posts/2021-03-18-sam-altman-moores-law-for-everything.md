There are parallels to Sam Altman's recent
essay, "[Moore's Law for Everything](https://moores.samaltman.com "Moore's Law for Everything")", with the well-known
essay by Marc
Adreessen, "[Why Software is Eating the World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/ "Why Software is Eating the World")",
shared in 2011.

Perhaps in a decade, we'll look back with reverence on this latest essay in the same way we view the 2011 entrant. With
the continued advances in AI, it does seem like he has it right.
