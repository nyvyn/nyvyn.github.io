Two related thoughts to consider:
1. I've been writing a lot of software in Python lately
2. I don't know really know Python

The "secret", of course, is that I'm using AI to co-write Python programs.

This approach is somewhat analogous to a person who can understand a spoken language,
but perhaps isn't that capable in speaking themselves.

In my case, I know enough about Python now to be able to read and understand the code,
but not well enough yet to write it on my own without taking a quick course or slowing
my progress by looking up references as needed.

And I certainly might take a class or get a certification soon if I continue to use Python.
But I won't stop using AI to help me. It's too good now and I'm faster with it than without.
