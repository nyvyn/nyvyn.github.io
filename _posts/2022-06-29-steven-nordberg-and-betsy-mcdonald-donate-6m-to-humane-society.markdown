A wonderful gift and a great example of the kind and generous people that they were.

> Steven Nordberg and Betsy McDonald were dedicated volunteers who cared for what are known as bottle babies — orphaned
> kittens that have to be raised and fed by hand, around the clock to start.
>
> “We knew that they had made a plan for animals in their estate,” Humane Society CEO Janelle Dixon said. “We had no
> idea of the dollar amount, so that $6 million gift was quite a surprise.”

(And the new Humane Society center on 280 looks to be amazing!)
