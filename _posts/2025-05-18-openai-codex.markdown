title: Initial thoughts on OpenAI Codex
tags: ["artificial intelligence", "software engineering"]

I recently shared a note on LinkedIn on the new Codex release:

> In trying out OpenAI's newly released Codex (a software coding agent in the cloud), I realized that the ability to launch multiple simultaneous coding tasks is a superpower.
> 
> The UI offers the ability to ask a question about a code base; the AI response then includes suggested tasks - each able to launch a coding agent.
> 
> This doesn’t obviate the need for more powerful AI than we have… but it does offer a way to quickly explore a variety of smaller-scoped efforts in parallel.
> 
> Overall: promising initial impression; but reserving judgement until I can better assess the results.

Another day in, and I'm even more excited about the potential.
