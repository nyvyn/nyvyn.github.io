Today I shared a note on LinkedIn about trying OpenAI's new Codex. Here is what I wrote:

Codex feels like a natural extension of the tools we already have for writing software. Being able to pose a single question and then spin up multiple agents to tackle separate tasks should make it easier to experiment and keep momentum. I'm looking forward to seeing how well it scales with larger and more complex projects.
