[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) describes a digital garden as:

> ...a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly
> organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory...

A garden shuns the reverse-chronological confines of a blog,
which are often fleeting glimpses of an idea.

In contrast, a digital garden is a collection of notes that are more durable and updated as relevant.

Below, are a few of these topical notes. More in the future.
