I'm happy to share my first open-source library:

[Autonomais](https://github.com/nyvyn/autonomais "Autonomais") â€“ a typescript library created
to streamline the coordination of autonomous agents.

Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind,
Autonomais helps developers build AI agent workflows.

Built on LangGraph.
